## Mode Details

### Self Service (Default)
The primary end-user-facing mode. Launched by a user clicking the Mac Health Check policy in MDM Self Service. Displays the full swiftDialog progress dialog with real-time status updates as each check runs. When Dock integration is enabled, the Dock badge counts down remaining checks. After report generation, normal runs launch a detached, moveable Inspect Mode Preset 6 guided summary with separate `Unhealthy` and `Healthy` sections while the main dialog still completes its existing `completionTimer` countdown. If the inspect config from a recent `Self Service` run is still valid and younger than `inspectReplayMaximumAgeSeconds`, rerunning the script replays the cached inspect summary after pre-flight/client-side installation and skips the health-check run plus the main dialog countdown. Set `inspectSummaryPreset="on"` to keep those Preset 6 behaviors enabled, or `off` to keep the standard completion flow only.

**When to use:** Standard deployment for user-initiated compliance checks.

---

### Silent
Runs health checks without displaying any user interface. Intended for scheduled background compliance runs and Client-Side Cache nightly cache refreshes. The `anticipationDuration` is automatically set to `0` in this mode to minimize execution time. Results are written to the client log and persisted to `/var/tmp/MacHealthCheck-Report.json`. Full health-check runs also write `/var/tmp/MacHealthCheck-Inspect-Config.json` and `/var/tmp/MacHealthCheck-Inspect-Compliance.plist` when `inspectSummaryPreset="on"`, without launching swiftDialog. The exact line `Splunk Reporting: local report written to /var/tmp/MacHealthCheck-Report.json` marks a fresh full-run write. The client-side LaunchDaemon run uses `splunkOperationMode=test`, so Splunk secrets stay in Jamf Pro policy parameters. Its plist has no `RunAtLoad`, routes stdout/stderr to `/dev/null`, and scheduled runs set `launchDaemonRun=true`, causing the script to apply deterministic per-Mac jitter across the 00:53-01:53 window centered on 1:23 a.m. If no GUI user is active during that refresh, user-scoped checks fall back to loginwindow `lastUserName`. When Jamf Pro later runs `Silent` with `splunkOperationMode=production`, the script uploads the cached report without running checks if the client-side script version matches and the cache is valid and younger than 36 hours. Reviewers can identify that path by `cached report is valid and <seconds>s old. Skipping health checks.` in the log. Operators can override that shortcut with Parameter 11 `forceFreshRun=true` or `/var/tmp/MacHealthCheck-Force-Fresh-Run`, which removes the cached JSON, forces a complete fresh run, and then delivers newly collected data to Splunk. In practice this often yields an overnight fresh-report write followed by a later-morning Jamf cached upload, so the latest Splunk delivery may contain data collected hours earlier even though the upload itself succeeded recently unless that override is used. Dock integration and other end-user follow-up UI are suppressed.

**When to use:** Continuous background compliance monitoring, nightly local report cache refreshes, and Jamf Pro Splunk uploads without repeating a full health-check run.

---

### Debug
Similar to Self Service, but with `set -x` tracing enabled plus swiftDialog debug launch arguments (`--verbose --resizable --debug red`). Debug mode also enables pretty-printed local JSON reporting, while intentionally retaining the existing countdown-based ending instead of launching the detached inspect summary. This makes it easier to identify which part of the zsh script or dialog rendering is causing unexpected behavior.

**When to use:** Diagnosing why a specific check is failing or returning an unexpected status.

---

### Development
Runs current development subset of checks in normal non-`Silent` dialog flow. In current release, the subset includes only `checkEntraIDRegistration()`, keeping feedback focused and fast without waiting for a full vendor-specific run.

**When to use:** Tuning targeted remediation copy, Entra registration reporting, or dialog presentation while keeping the run far shorter than a full production policy.

---

### Test
Builds the full current vendor list item set, then marks each item as a successful simulated result without executing the real health-check functions. The UI renders like production, making this mode useful for validating dialog layout, list item labels, status icon sequencing, and the overall visual presentation.

**When to use:** Verifying UI behavior after changing dialog configuration, list item labels, or overall script structure.

## Setting the Operation Mode

Operation mode is set via **Parameter 4** in the MDM policy:

```
# MDM Script Parameter 4
Self Service    ← default; omit parameter to use this
Silent
Debug
Development
Test
```

For local testing, pass the mode as the fourth argument:

```bash
sudo zsh Mac-Health-Check.zsh "" "" "" "Debug"
```
