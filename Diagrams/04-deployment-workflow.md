## Detailed Step-by-Step Guide

### Phase 1: Prerequisites

Before deploying Mac Health Check, confirm:

- [ ] An MDM solution is in place (Jamf Pro, Kandji, Microsoft Intune, Mosyle, JumpCloud, Addigy, Filewave, or Fleet)
- [ ] `jq` is present on target Macs that do not already bundle it
- [ ] `swiftDialog` is approved for your environment and is either preinstalled or allowed to auto-install/update
- [ ] You have downloaded the latest `Mac-Health-Check.zsh` from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dan-snelson/Mac-Health-Check)

---

### Phase 2: Script Customization

Open `Mac-Health-Check.zsh` and review the **Organization Variables** and **IT Support Variables** sections.

**Required changes:**
| Variable | What to Set |
|---|---|
| `organizationBrandingBannerURL` | Your organization's banner image URL |
| `organizationOverlayiconURL` | Your MDM self-service app icon path or URL |
| `enableDockIntegration` / `dockIcon` | Whether to show Dock integration in non-`Silent` modes and which icon to use |
| `vpnClientVendor` | `paloalto`, `cisco`, `tailscale`, or `none` |
| `organizationFirewall` | `socketfilterfw` (most orgs) or `pf` |
| `supportLabel1` / `supportValue1` (and additional pairs as needed) | Dynamic support lines and the first URL-like action for the Info button |

**Optional changes:**
| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `allowedUptimeMinutes` | `10080` (7 days) | Uptime warning threshold |
| `allowedMinimumFreeDiskPercentage` | `10` | Free disk error threshold |
| `previousMinorOS` | `2` | How many older macOS versions are compliant |
| `completionTimer` | `60` | Fallback dialog auto-close (seconds) |

`webhookURL` is configured as **Parameter 5** in the MDM policy, not as a long-lived script default. Splunk reporting is likewise enabled through runtime parameters rather than hard-coded tokens in the script.

---

### Phase 3: External Checks (Optional, Jamf Pro Only)

If your organization uses BeyondTrust, Cisco Umbrella, CrowdStrike, or GlobalProtect:

1. Review the scripts in `external-checks/` and customize as needed
2. Upload each external check script to Jamf Pro with its trigger name (e.g., `symvCrowdStrikeFalcon`)
3. Set `organizationDefaultsDomain` in `Mac-Health-Check.zsh` to match the domain used by external check policies
4. Ensure `checkExternalJamfPro` calls at the bottom of the Jamf Pro check set reference the correct trigger names

---

### Phase 4: MDM Upload

1. Upload the customized `Mac-Health-Check.zsh` to your MDM as a script
2. Configure the script parameters:
   - **Parameter 4** — Operation mode (start with `Debug` for initial testing)
   - **Parameter 5** — Webhook URL (optional)
   - **Parameters 6-10** — Splunk reporting mode, HEC URL, HEC token, HEC index, and HEC sourcetype
   - **Parameter 11** — `forceFreshRun` one-shot override for Jamf `Silent` + `production` cache bypass when you need next eligible run to recollect data instead of re-uploading cached JSON

---

### Phase 5: Self Service Policy

Create an MDM policy with:
- **Script:** `Mac-Health-Check.zsh`, Parameter 4 = `Self Service`
- **Self Service:** Enabled with a descriptive name, icon, and category
- **Scope:** Start with a test group; expand to full fleet after validation

---

### Phase 6: Silent Mode Policy and Client-Side Cache (Optional)

For background compliance monitoring, create a second policy:
- **Script:** `Mac-Health-Check.zsh`, Parameter 4 = `Silent`, Parameter 6 = `production`
- **Trigger:** Login, recurring check-in, or scheduled
- **No Self Service entry** — runs silently in the background
- **Splunk parameters:** Provide HEC URL/token/index/sourcetype from Jamf Pro policy parameters only
- **Client-Side Cache:** Non-`Silent` runs and full Jamf production runs install `/Library/Management/org.churchofjesuschrist/MHC.zsh` plus `org.churchofjesuschrist.MHC`; the script validates and loads a root LaunchDaemon without `RunAtLoad`, routes daemon stdout/stderr to `/dev/null`, and the client-side LaunchDaemon refreshes the local JSON report nightly with deterministic per-Mac jitter across 00:53-01:53 without uploading to Splunk
- When Jamf Pro runs `Silent` + `production`, matching client/server versions and a valid report under 36 hours old allow cached upload without re-running health checks
- When stale data must be overwritten immediately, set Parameter 11 to `true` for one policy invocation or create `/var/tmp/MacHealthCheck-Force-Fresh-Run` before next eligible `Silent` + `production` run; both paths bypass cached upload and force a complete fresh run
- Expect two common timestamps in healthy production telemetry: an overnight full `Silent` refresh that writes fresh local JSON, then a later Jamf `Silent` + `production` policy that uploads that cached JSON without re-running checks

---

### Phase 7: Testing

Use the three developer-oriented modes to validate behavior before rolling out to all users:

| Mode | Purpose | How to Use |
|---|---|---|
| `Debug` | Shell tracing (`set -x`) for troubleshooting | Run policy and review MDM logs |
| `Development` | Exercise only `checkEntraIDRegistration()` in normal dialog flow | Set Parameter 4 to `Development` |
| `Test` | Build the full current vendor list and mark each item successful without running the real checks | Validate UI layout and messages |

---

### Phase 8: Monitoring

After production deployment, monitor:

- **Client logs** at `/var/log/org.churchofjesuschrist.log` on managed Macs — look for `[WARNING]` and `[ERROR]` entries
- **Client-Side Cache assets** — confirm `/Library/Management/org.churchofjesuschrist/MHC.zsh`, `/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.churchofjesuschrist.MHC.plist`, and `/var/tmp/MacHealthCheck-Report.json` exist on test Macs
- **LaunchDaemon jitter** — confirm the plist starts at 00:53, does not include `RunAtLoad`, and the client log records `Client-Side Cache: Jitter offset = X seconds` during daemon-triggered runs
- **Fresh-write marker** — confirm full runs log `Splunk Reporting: local report written to /var/tmp/MacHealthCheck-Report.json`; this is the canonical proof that new report data was generated locally
- **Cached-upload marker and age** — confirm later Jamf `Silent` + `production` uploads log `cached report is valid and <seconds>s old. Skipping health checks.` so operators can distinguish delivery time from collection time
- **Force Fresh Run marker** — confirm bypassed runs log `Client-Side Cache: FORCE FRESH RUN triggered ...` followed by a fresh-write marker instead of cached-upload notices
- **Dock badge, inspect summary handoff, cached replay, and unhealthy end-state handling** on test Macs in non-`Silent` modes — confirm countdown badges update per check, `Self Service` launches the detached moveable Preset 6 guided summary with separate `Unhealthy` and `Healthy` sections during the retained main-dialog countdown when `inspectSummaryPreset="on"`, reruns replay the cached summary after pre-flight/client-side installation without re-running checks only while the cached handoff file remains younger than `inspectReplayMaximumAgeSeconds`, and failed runs now rely on the unhealthy main-dialog state plus the detached `Self Service` summary instead of a pseudo-alert notification
- **Webhook notifications** in Teams or Slack (if configured) — review failure summaries
- **MDM inventory** — Jamf Pro interactive/full runs can still trigger inventory submission, while `Silent` + Splunk production and Client-Side Cache LaunchDaemon runs skip it
