# Mac Health Check Documentation Diagrams (4.0.0)

## Overview

This directory contains Mermaid-based diagrams aligned to the `4.0.0` release of [Mac Health Check](https://snelson.us/mhc). The diagrams render automatically on GitHub and cover the current deployment, runtime, operation-mode, and health-check behavior documented by the script, README, and changelog.

Keep these files in sync with `Mac-Health-Check.zsh`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` whenever the check inventory, operation modes, Dock behavior, or user-facing flow changes.

## Rendering Options

### GitHub (Recommended)
Mermaid diagrams render automatically when viewing `.md` files on GitHub. No setup required.

### VS Code
1. Install the [Markdown Preview Mermaid Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) extension
2. Open any `.md` file and press `Cmd+Shift+V` to preview

### Mermaid Live Editor
1. Open [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live)
2. Copy the contents of any `mermaid` code block
3. Paste into the editor for interactive viewing and PNG/SVG export

## Exporting to PNG or SVG

Use the [Mermaid CLI](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) for high-resolution exports:

```bash
# Install Mermaid CLI
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# Export a diagram to PNG (standard, for blog posts / documentation)
mmdc -i 01-system-architecture.md -o 01-system-architecture.png -w 1200

# Export a diagram to PNG (high-resolution, for presentations)
mmdc -i 01-system-architecture.md -o 01-system-architecture.png -w 3840

# Export a diagram to SVG (vector, ideal for documentation sites)
mmdc -i 01-system-architecture.md -o 01-system-architecture.svg
```

## Color Palette

All diagrams use a consistent color scheme:

| Color | Hex | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| Light Blue | `#e1f5ff` | Script components, code files |
| Light Green | `#c8e6c9` | Success states, deployment artifacts |
| Light Yellow | `#fff4e6` / `#ffecb3` | Processing steps, decisions |
| Light Red | `#ffcdd2` | Error / critical states |
| Light Purple | `#f3e5f5` | Configuration, preferences |
| Light Grey | `#cfd8dc` | Exit paths, inactive states |
| Light Teal | `#b2dfdb` | Data collection, check execution |

---

## File Naming Convention

Files follow the pattern `[NN]-[descriptive-name].md`:

- `NN` — Two-digit sequence number for logical ordering
- `descriptive-name` — Lowercase, hyphen-separated description

When adding a new diagram, use the next available sequence number and follow the same header structure as existing files (title, overview, Mermaid block, component descriptions).
